Revision history for Perl module Pod::Webserver:

3.08  Fri Feb 14 13:28:00 2014
	- Change t/daemon.t to use $ENV{PODWBSERVERPORT} || 39383, not 8020, for both server and client.
		This means tests run even if 'podwebserver' is aleady running.

3.07  Fri Feb 14 12:00:00 2014
	- Split out each package into its own file.
	- Rearrange methods per file into alphabetical order.
	- Clean up datestamps in this file.

3.06  Mon Feb 10 12:00:00 2014
	- Ron Savage is now co-maint.
	- Remove 'require 5;' from the source. If you're running Perl V 4, you'll have even more problems now.
	- Add a -t (timeout) parameter. The unit is seconds. Timeout defaults (as always) to 18,000 = 5 hours.
		This addresses RT#21582. Thanx to Ivor Williams for the 2006 report.
		Yes, it has been a regrettably long time, hasn't it?
	- Remove spaces in option string passed to Getopt::Std.
		This addresses RT#44520. Thanx to Marek.Rouchal for the 2009 report.
		This problem was also noted in RT#55106. Thanx to COSMICNET for the 2010 report.
		This problem was also noted in RT#62939. Thanx to Allison Randal for the 2010 report.
	- Add -d (dirs to include) and -e (dirs to exclude) parameters.
		This addresses RT#55106. Thanx to COSMICNET for the 2010 patch.
	- Flag RT#59890 as not-an-error, since http://localhost:8020/pods/perlfaq is not (presumably) output by
		the code, and hence is not the jumping-off point for any within-FAQ links.
	- Re-word error messages, and use die rather than a combination of die and Carp.
	- Change licence from Perl to Artistic 2, since the Perl licence is not listed at http://opensource.org/licenses.
	- Switch tests from using Test to Test::More.
	- Move podwebserver script into bin/.
	- Add Build.PL.
	- Create repository on github and add to Build.PL and Makefile.PL.
	- Add t/version.t.
	- Add xt/author/pod.t.
	- Expand docs slightly.
	- Ensure port and timeout parameters are integers. Print help and exit if not.
	- Expand help message.
	- Include File::Spec in the pre-reqs. It's used by the new -d and -e options.
	- Replace brief MANIFEST.SKIP with long version (copied from GraphViz2).
	- Reformat this file so it can be read by Module::Metadata::Changes' ini.report.pl.
	- Rename ChangeLog to Changes.
	- Add Changelog.ini (output of ini.report.pl).

3.04  Tue Sep 12 12:00:00 2006

3.03  Sun Jun 20 12:00:00 2004
	- Sean M. Burke <sburke@cpan.org>
